# 🏠 Airbnb Web Scraping Analysis & EDA

This repository contains a comprehensive project developed during my internship at **CodeAlpha**. It involves **web scraping** data from Airbnb listings, followed by **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and deriving key insights about rental trends.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to:
- Scrape Airbnb listings from the web (Cairo, Egypt).
- Extract useful features such as **price, location, rating, description, and host details**.
- Handle data inconsistencies, currency formats, and missing values.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** to uncover patterns and trends.
- Visualize insights using charts and plots.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` – for web scraping
- `pandas`, `numpy` – for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` – for data visualization
- `re` – for regular expressions and text processing

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Scrapes **multiple pages** of Airbnb listings.
- 💸 Handles **currency symbols**, **discounts**, and **incomplete data**.
- 🔍 Converts textual information (like `"5 nights for EGP 2000"`) into structured columns.
- 📊 Performs EDA on:
  - Price distribution
  - Ratings vs. price
  - Most common locations
  - Discounts and sales impact
- ⚙️ Uses **exception handling** for robust scraping.
